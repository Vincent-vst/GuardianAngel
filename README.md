# GuardianAngel  

## How to use it  

Gardian Angel is meant to be an alternative to the rm command.
Instead of deindexing the files, it simply move them to the wastebin.

Installation : 
```bash
chmod+x GuardianAngel.sh
GuardianAngel --help
```

Then I suggest to add an alias in your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` or whatever you're using 
```
alias rm='GuardianAngel'
```

I personaly like to alias it to something else than `rm` just so i can keep the rm command in case i need it.
